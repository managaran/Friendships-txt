# Friendships-txt

Learning Objectives:
Students will create databases.

Students will use SQL queries and self joins.

In the previous chapter, you created the friendships_schema. Now, you'll get the chance to forward engineer this schema, and use queries to manipulate the database. Imagine you're in charge of maintaining the database of a new social networking site! In this role, you need to manage the data that is displayed, including who users consider their "friends" online.



After adding users to the database and creating some relationships, your results should look like below:

first_name	last_name	friend_first_name	friend_last_name
Amy	Giver	Eli	Byers
Amy	Giver	Big	Bird
Amy	Giver	Kermit	The Frog
Eli	Byers	Kermit	The Frog
Eli 	Byers	Marky	Mark
Marky 	Mark	Big	Bird
Your actual query will look something similar to this:

SELECT * FROM users 
JOIN friendships ON ____=____ 
LEFT JOIN users as user2 ON ____ = ____
copy
Take note that we're joining the users table again but we're specifying the second users table as user2.  You can then reference the second users by calling user2 (e.g. user2.id, user2.first_name, etc).  

You can also rename the fields that are displayed on the result by using the as keyword, like the below example:   

SELECT user2.first_name as friend_first_name, user2.last_name as friend_last_name, ...  FROM ...
copy
Knowing how to do joins can be tricky but is used quite often and will most likely appear again in your belt exam.



If you get stuck on selecting, joining, and retrieving users and friendships, be sure to apply the 20 minute rule! Try re-reading the previous modules and doing research on your own, then reaching out to your peers on Discord, and finally setting up some time with a Coding Dojo staff member so that you talk through the challenge you're facing.

Forward engineer the friendships_schema from the previous chapter

Query: Create 6 new users

Query: Have user 1 be friends with user 2, 4 and 6

Query: Have user 2 be friends with user 1, 3 and 5

Query: Have user 3 be friends with user 2 and 5

Query: Have user 4 be friends with user 3

Query: Have user 5 be friends with user 1 and 6

Query: Have user 6 be friends with user 2 and 3

Query: Display the relationships create as shown in the above image

NINJA Query: Return all users who are friends with the first user, make sure their names are displayed in results.

NINJA Query: Return the count of all friendships

NINJA Query: Find out who has the most friends and return the count of their friends.

NINJA Query: Return the friends of the third user in alphabetical order
